build_flags = -DENABLE_RX_ECHO

; If using a BLE gamepad (e.g. PS4, Xbox One S, 8BitDo), keep NimBLE.
; Notes:
; - Added NimBLE-Arduino for BLE central with pairing/encryption.
; - If reverting to Bluedroid, remove NimBLE-Arduino and switch includes back to <BLEDevice.h>.
; - Bluepad32 (BT Classic) intentionally removed: ESP32-S3 is BLE-only so PS3/Classic pads unsupported.
