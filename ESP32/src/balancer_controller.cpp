// This file used to contain the PIDController implementation.
// Implementation has been moved to `src/pid_controller.cpp` to avoid
// duplicate definitions. Keep this file as a small shim so existing
// build setups that reference it continue to work.

#include "../include/pid_controller.h"

// No definitions here; implementation is in src/pid_controller.cpp
